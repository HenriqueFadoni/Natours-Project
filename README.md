# Natours-Project

Natours is a fictional travel agency page. The application is entirely static, the main goal of this project was to test new CSS/SASS animations and ideas.

## What I have learned

I have learned to use BEM concepts, CSS tricks that trigger functionalities, as well as some nice animations in CSS/SASS. For example: the rotation cards.

## Technologies
